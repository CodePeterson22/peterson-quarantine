    <h1> Quarentine Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Hello, what I have been doing over quarentine is trying to go outside as much as possible when the weather is nice. Outside I like to ride my bike, play basketball, sit outside in the fresh air, etc. However, when the weather does not coroporate I play video games with my friends and watch movies with my parents. </h2>

    <h2>My favorite hobbies in general are hanging out with my friends at the park and playing sports. We like to play basketball, football, spikeball, etc. I also like hanging out with my neighbors in their pool and playing cards with them late at night. We like to play texas holdem a lot.
